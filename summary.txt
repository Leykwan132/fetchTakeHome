tools
The tools that I'm using is VSCode. VSCode is useful with extensions given and I have had some school projects built using VSCode on top of some useful extension.

library
csv library is used to read the csv. Sys library is used to read the system argument entered by the user.

Why Python?
I am pretty comfortable with Python since I have taken some classes related to Python and some Python coding for data visualization purpose.
I chose Python because Python has some built-in data structure that could come handy when it comes to implementation.

2. Advantages:
The time complexity is nlogn because of the sorting and space complexity is constant since we are just creating 1 array and 1 dict.

Disadvantages:
The code might be little bit messy since a number of conditional statement is used. 


3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
I did a full stack personal project from scratch, StalkYourLinkedin, from designing to deploying. It was my favourite because I designed it the way I wanted it to be, something that looks visually pleasing to me. 
The most challenging part would be debugging some of the algorithm when it comes to utilizing nextJS and supaBase. I almost gave up when I was unable to find a solution on StackOverflow but eventually I solved multiple bugs by going
through the documentation and connecting with the dev team of a product to get more insights. It was a fun and fruitful experience for me personally.
